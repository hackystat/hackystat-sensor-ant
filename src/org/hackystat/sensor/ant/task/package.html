Implements a Checkstyle sensor for the Ant build system, which sends Code Issue
data generated by the Checkstyle tool to a Hackystat server as CodeIssue sensor data.
<br><br>
This sensor is designed to run after the Checkstyle task in Ant, which creates a XML file 
of issues that are found. This sensor reads in those files and uses that data to 
construct the notification that is sent to the server.
