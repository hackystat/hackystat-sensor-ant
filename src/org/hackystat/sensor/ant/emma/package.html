Implements a Emma sensor for the Ant build system, which sends coverage data generated 
by Emma to the Hackystat server as a set of Coverage sensor data instances. 
<br><br>
This sensor is designed to run after the Emma Report task in Ant. The Emma Report 
task must be included to create a XML file containing the coverage summary.  This 
sensor reads in this file and uses its data to construct the notification that is 
sent to the server.
