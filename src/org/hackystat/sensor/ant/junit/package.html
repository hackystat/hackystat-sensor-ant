Implements a JUnit sensor for the Ant build system, which sends unit test 
outcome data generated by the JUnit tool to a Hackystat server as UnitTest
sensor data.
This sensor is designed to run after the JUnit task in Ant.  The JUnit task must be
configured to save out the results of tests into XML files.  This sensor reads in those
files and uses that data to construct the notification that is sent to the server.
